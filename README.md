## Tips

#### Flow

##### Keep Flow types up to date
After adding new packages with `yarn`, run `yarn update:flow` to keep flow types up to date with the `flow-typed` community repository.


#### Feathers

##### Scaffolding

Feathers has a powerful command line interface. Here are a few things it can do:

```
$ yarn global add @feathersjs/cli         # Install Feathers CLI

$ feathers generate service               # Generate a new Service
$ feathers generate hook                  # Generate a new Hook
$ feathers generate model                 # Generate a new Model
$ feathers help                           # Show all commands
```
